An Absolute Banger* With A Strong Message Within!
"Thunderbolts" it's some of Marvel's darkest material to date, dealing with the emotional wreckage of broken individuals grappling with their past choices and finding camaraderie amidst the emptiness of their lives. This may be a team-up movie, but it very much belongs to Florence Pugh, who carries much of the dramatic weight of the movie on her back, while Lewis Pullman delivers a complex performance as a sympathetic character at war with himself. The imperfections somehow all feel fitting for this anti-hero team of misfits. Putting emphasis on the character work and practical action makes this feel like the old Marvel that has us for a decade plus. Wish we'd gotten this sooner.

"Thunderbolts*" it's a bold dive into trauma, healing, and redemption. Proof that even the so-called defective losers and disposable delinquents can rise above their past and become the heroes no one expected. It's gritty, emotional and unlike anything Marvel has done before - a must-see story that hits where it hurts and heals where it matters.

I can tell that the movie is one of Marvel's most enjoyable films in a while. It feels different than most of the studio's projects. Its bold, funny, filled with great action and an unexpected emotional punch. It has the rewatchable factor for sure. Has so much spark, charisma, and tells a genuinely emotional story you connect with.

It is truly fantastic, the cast has electric chemistry with each other (Florence Pugh & Lewis Pullman are the standouts) and the action sequences are very strong. But most of all, the movie's story is bold, important & so well-written. Florence Pugh brings the heart, David Harbour is consistently funny, & Lewis Pullman might be the stealth MVP.

This is probably one of he most if not the most humane movie filled with allowing their anti hero being flawed, broken and regretful. Sebastian Stan has an absolute scene stealing moment, yet Florence Pugh shows she is the true lead of the new generation and team. She is the star, that shines the brightest. There's a lot to love in this movie honestly.

A visually daring, emotionally resonant superhero movie that pushes mental health to the forefront. The MCU future is bright. Definitely stick around after the credits, there are 2 scenes and the last one will make you so hyped!

Thunderbolts Doesn't Fight Monsters. It Fights Depression, Trauma, and Isolation
Thunderbolts* is unlike anything we've seen before in a superhero blockbuster. Its bold focus on mental health is the beating heart of the film, shaping the story in a way that's refreshingly original. We've had plenty of superhero (and anti-hero) movies, but none have tackled mental health as deeply or as honestly as this. This is as fresh as it gets, and the film hits its message squarely on the mark. Could that message have been louder or more powerful? Absolutely. But is it enough for audiences to understand, feel, and reflect on? Without a doubt. It's a gem that invites viewers to empathize, to look inward, and to recognize the struggles of those around them. In many ways, Thunderbolts feels like a superhero in its own right, delivering a powerful PSA that's woven seamlessly into the narrative rather than feeling tacked on.

We're in love with the concept here; an anti-hero film built around mental health. It makes the story and the character arcs far deeper and more meaningful than they'd be if these were just your typical caped crusaders. Thunderbolts* is the MCU's rawest exploration of mental health to date. We've heard the words "trauma" and "healing" tossed around in superhero flicks before like WandaVision, but this is different. This film doesn't just mention the weight of mental health, it lives in it. Yelena's story, in particular, has been carefully nurtured since Phase 4, and the decision to continue her journey down this road is nothing short of brilliant. Yelena, like Black Widow before her, isn't a superhero with powers. She's human. She's flawed, resilient, and painfully relatable and that makes her journey hit even harder.

We actually like the character dynamics between the anti-heroes. We like that every of their personality shines. Their dynamics push the film's mental health themes even further. These might have been the underdogs of previous movies, characters we barely remembered but here, they get their moment. And wow, do they deliver. Each one gets time to prove they're so much more than sidekicks or forgotten faces and by the end, you can't help but root for them.

What's especially moving is how much these characters matter both to themselves and to each other. They've all been torn down, denigrated, beaten back, and made to feel like the world is against them. They're loners by nature, forced into the uncomfortable space of working as a team for the first time. Watching them navigate that, to lean on each other when things fall apart, is both heartwarming and powerful. It's a clear reminder of the importance of friendship, of admitting when you need help, and of realizing that none of us can do it all alone.

The action sequences in this are great. It's a blast watching everyone throw down and show off their skills. But here's the thing, while the action is awesome, it's not what makes this film great. This movie proves that a superhero film doesn't need to lean on endless explosions to leave an impact. The story itself is raw, human, and beautifully told and that is more than enough. That's why Thunderbolts* stands tall in the post-Endgame era. The action is tight, but the storytelling is what really puts it over the top.

And guess what? They didn't rely on cameos. We could safely say that Deadpool vs Wolverine, Spider-Man: No Way Home and Thunderbolts* are the top 3 films after Avengers Endgame but what Thunderbolts* sets apart from the other two is it's the only one that doesn't rely on cameos. It doesn't need nostalgic bait, it doesn't need 'help' from anyone, it's just them trying to save the day and trying to figure out how to solve the problems they are in. And we love them for it.

Florence Pugh, as always, is a knockout. She's never missed a beat, and once again, she's phenomenal here. Her accent might not be perfect, but who cares? She's a powerhouse, carrying the weight of a character struggling with identity and searching for meaning. She's the voice of so many who feel lost or stuck, and Pugh brings that to life with so much heart. She's a beacon of hope, a reminder that even when it feels impossible, there's light at the end of the tunnel. The rest of the cast? Stellar too. Lewis Pullman deserves a special shoutout. He proves here that he's a force to be reckoned with. Forget the early skepticism about his casting. He owns it completely, and Hollywood seriously needs to give this guy more credit.

And yes, Malaysia plays a huge role in this film and the Menara Merdeka 118 shot is breathtaking. Instead of the usual sunny, warm tones we often see, the film opts for a moodier palette blue, dark, and cloudy which beautifully matches the film's somber, reflective theme. It just fits.

The third act really dives deep into the mental health themes, in a way that feels raw and personal. The true villain here isn't a monster or alien, it's the demons we all battle inside. It emphasizes this theme in a way that feels plausible, personable and relatable. A villain that lives within all of us. A villain that everyone of us has battled against in some way and some parts in our lives. How much you connect with the film might depend on how you view your life and how much experience you've dealt with but one thing's for sure, it'll leave you thinking long after the credits roll.

Was anything wasted in this film? There is one. One character didn't get nearly the spotlight they deserved. Everyone else got their moment to shine except for one and that felt like a missed opportunity.

As for the comedy, it's hit and miss. Some of it lands really well. The belly-laugh kind of good while other moments fall flat or feel a bit forced. Some jokes could've used a little more setup, and a few felt repetitive, but overall, there's enough good humor sprinkled in.

We did feel like the third act could have fleshed out more. It could have used more breathing room. It moves fast, too fast at times and some moments feel rushed or a bit disjointed. If they'd let things simmer just a bit longer, it could have been even more impactful.

And yes, Thunderbolts* has 2 credits scene. The first one is simply light and funny which is bearable enough but the second one will hype everyone up for what's to come. Not that it's important to reveal it at the end credits but with audience losing hope for the future of MCU, this will get everyone back on their feet, cheering and hoping that Phase 6 will be the same with what Phase 3 had to offer...or at least almost.

Verdict: Thunderbolts* is the anti-hero film we didn't know we needed. It delivers a story rooted in something we all face: mental health. This is raw. It's personal. And it feels relatable and real. It explores themes of isolation, trauma, and the power of asking for help, making it one of the MCU's most personal stories yet. It ditches the nostalgia bait and focuses on characters wrestling with their own demons, making their journeys relatable and impactful. The action is tight, but it's the emotional weight that truly lands (Yes, we did cry a bit). Florence Pugh leads with power and vulnerability, backed by a stellar cast and the famous Malaysia's Menara Merdeka 118 isn't just cinematic, it symbolizes the towering weight these characters carry. Thank you, Marvel.

The MCU Pulled Me Back In, And I Wasn't Expecting It
I walked into the theater with rock-bottom expectations. Let's be real, the last few MCU movies haven't exactly been blowing anyone away. I figured this one would be another forgettable installment, and honestly, the only reason I was there was Florence Pugh. If anyone could salvage whatever mess they'd thrown together, it was her.

But to my surprise, I really liked it. Like, really liked it. It even hit me emotionally, which I did NOT see coming. The film tackled mental health in a way I wasn't expecting, reminding us that bottling everything up isn't the answer. Instead, it encouraged facing your struggles, surrounding yourself with people who truly care, and letting them lift you up when you need it most.

Of course, it wasn't all serious. David Harbour brought the humor with his signature one liners, making sure things stayed fun. What I thought would be just another MCU letdown turned into something that actually stuck with me. Maybe, just maybe, the franchise still has some surprises left.

Explosive (and emotional) in more ways than one... You're up for a turbulent ride !
This film has something... It has something endearing about it and is fairly memorable, I think.

First, I love this whole erratic chemistry, but strong chemistry nonetheless ; and the way they assembled this team of misfits is obviously not without reminding us of these oh so tasty ensemble action movies from the 90s !!...

And yeah, we have already witnessed these various characters in different situations (at the exception of a particular one), so we know what they are capable of and how things could eventually go south in and off the field quite likely, but at the same time we also have never seen them put in such a chaotic situation as a newly formed (and seemingly dysfunctional) team...

But this movie's biggest strength lies in its emotional core and the way each of the different protagonists face the events that happen on their path...

So it truly feels good to experience each of all this -not so- little moments and how the characters distinctively react and grow from there ; it's really nice to see how they all evolve, step by step, whether it is as a team or on their individual journeys... Yes, you feel the growth in strength of the team as a whole, how they understand each other, but moreover they instinctively end up figuring out the part they have to play for the sake of all... And this comes from each of their inner struggles and subsequently from the self discoveries that arise from that ; which is a process that is truly enjoyable to see all along the movie... Especially because Marvel Studios know how to craft these entertaining human interactions, through hilarious banters and zany situations indeed (which of course make the various connections tangible and tasty), but also by progressively carving relatable characters with life trajectories that give them a greater depth once mysteries unveil and stakes progressively rise...

To be noted that the political themes (control, manipulation, corruption) as well as the introduction of a particularly iconic new character, both are a slow burn that offer a great richness to the story, once its dynamics take a new turn and the threat that was hanging over it from the shadow becomes concrete ; with some very crisp and effectively impactful scenes and moments (whether it Is through the juicy dialogues or the cool action scenes, which all have a precise purpose as well as a language that viscerally demonstrates the extent of the impact of this series of choices and events)...

That was for sure a very enjoyable ride all the way, and what must be emphasized is how the whole movie is filled with a fair amount of deeply humane emotions (the psychology behind each of the characters and how each of them try to carve their way in order to find a bigger purpose in their existence despite the burden of the dark pages of their life)...which gives this film an extra soul that is everything but insignificant and takes its story to a higher level. In the end, the movie offers a pretty organic trajectory to all the main characters ; and it gives a lot of sense and meaning to what we just saw as well as future of these characters and the Marvel Cinematic Universe moving forward (the two post-credit scenes give you some more of that taste while obviously inviting you to watch the new future stories to come)... Purely delightful and quite satisfying overall ! Definitely.

Not your typical Marvel movie.
Okay, so Marvel definitely succeeded to up thier game in this movie. They took it to a completely different category of storytelling. I was certainly impressed with the symbolism and how they portrayed "depression" and a human-being's darkness. Beautifully done in terms of tackling mental issues and shedding light into this topic. Also, the cast and assembling the ragtag team of misfits was great and funny. Good team dynamic as they were able to make them click and sync together beautifully. I loved the movie, it made my eyes tear up at some moments that were emotionally deep and genuine. Bravo Marvel Studios, you certainly nailed this one.

Trivia

Florence Pugh loves heights and wanted to be the one to jump off the Merdeka 118 building in the opening, and she incessantly emailed Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige about not using a stunt double. "As we got closer and closer to shooting, they said they don't think it's going to happen because it's a crazy insurance ordeal and obviously we're not going to throw [me] off the second tallest building in the world," Pugh said. "I was like what the f*ck? Of course we are! We have to do that." "I was being a sassy Karen emailing Kevin and saying it's going to do wonders for the press tour," she continued. "We have to do this! We're going to have three women break three different Guinness World Records and we'll do this and this. I had to keep on pushing and then they're like, 'Okay, if you want to fall off the second tallest building, we'll figure it out for you.'"

Quotes

Yelena Belova: Daddy, I'm so alone. I don't have anything anymore. All I do is sit, and look at my phone, and think of all the terrible things that I've done, and then I go to work, and then I drink, come home to no-one, and I sit and think about all the terrible things I've done again and again and I go crazy!

Alexei Shostakov: Yelena, stop. We all have things that we regret.

Yelena Belova: No, but I have so many!

[bursts into tears]

Yelena Belova: My first test at the Red Room... Anya, she was just a child, she was so small...

Alexei Shostakov: So were you. I know; I know they were dark times -- very, very dark times, but... before, you were such a special little girl. Did you know this? You walked into room and made it bright. You felt a lot of joy.
